	<h3>A Brief Collection of Skylahr's Hobbies. My Hobbies. There's Been A Lot.</h3>
	<p> Sewing, photography, video editing, computer programming, painting, sketching, makeup, looking cool,
	hair styling, cosplay, I don't know I'm sure there are others, this assingment was very vague and I'm not 
	entirely sure what I should be putting here. Either way, below I'll embed one of the crumby videos I made a year ago.
